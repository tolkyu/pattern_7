There is a multi-storey building, on each floor of which there is a certain number of rooms (rooms can be added). The building has a common electrical panel that can be diagnosed. There are also shields on each floor, as well as in each room. Develop an electrician class that bypasses and diagnoses all the floors and rooms in the building.
